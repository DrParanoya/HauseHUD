# HauseHUD
Renders an image to block your vision. 
For 1.21.4 (probably works on older versions too, just try it).  
Rn only image.png in assets.  
Width and heigth can be changed, default is 255x255.  
I will add support for using images inside a subfolder of .minecraft\meteor-client in the futureâ„¢  

```gradlew build```
